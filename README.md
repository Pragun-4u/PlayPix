## Features

### 1. Dynamic Video Search

PlayPix leverages caching and debouncing techniques to provide users with instant and smooth search results as they type in the search bar. No more waiting for search results to load; PlayPix keeps pace with your search queries.

### 2. Video Details

On the video watch page, users can access a wealth of information about the video they're watching, including:

- Video title
- Views count
- Likes count
- Description

### 3. Comments Section

Engage with the video's community by reading and posting comments on the video. Share your thoughts, ask questions, and connect with others who have watched the same content.

### 4. Recommended Videos

Discover new content effortlessly with PlayPix's recommended videos section. Based on your viewing history and preferences, PlayPix suggests similar videos that you might enjoy.

### 5. Mock Live Chat

Experience the excitement of a live chat while watching videos. PlayPix utilizes API polling behind the scenes to simulate a chatroom where users can interact with each other during video playback.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
